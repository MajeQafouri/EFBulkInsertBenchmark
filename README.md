# EF Bulk Insert Benchmark

In this project, I have implemented bulk insert in different ways and elapsed time was calculated for every technique.

3 different techniques for bulk insert by Entity framework :


1-using EFCore.BulkExtensions => https://github.com/borisdj/EFCore.BulkExtensions

2-using Bulk-Operations => https://github.com/zzzprojects/Bulk-Operations

3-using EF core AddRange  => https://github.com/dotnet/efcore



you can add other ways to this project
