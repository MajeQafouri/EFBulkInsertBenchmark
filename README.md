# .Net Bulk Insert Benchmark

In this project, I have implemented bulk insert in different ways and elapsed time was calculated for every technique.

4 different techniques for bulk insert by Entity framework :


1- EFCore.BulkExtensions => https://github.com/borisdj/EFCore.BulkExtensions

2- Bulk-Operations => https://github.com/zzzprojects/Bulk-Operations

3- EF core AddRange  => https://github.com/dotnet/efcore

4- Microsoft SqlBulkCopy => https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlbulkcopy?view=dotnet-plat-ext-5.0



you can add other techniques to this project
